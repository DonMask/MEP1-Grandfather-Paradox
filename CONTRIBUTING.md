# Contributing to MEP1: Quantum Temporal Entanglement and Conscious Resonance

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Mental-Experimental Prototype 1 (MEP1)! This project explores quantum temporal entanglement to resolve the grandfather paradox, and we welcome contributions from researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to extend its scope and impact.

## How to Contribute

We encourage contributions in various forms, including theoretical expansions, new simulations, experimental validations, code improvements, or documentation enhancements. Below are the steps to get started:

### 1. Fork the Repository
- Click the "Fork" button at the top of the repository page (`https://github.com/DonMask/MEP1-Grandfather-Paradox`).
- Clone your fork to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MEP1-Grandfather-Paradox.git
